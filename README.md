## 📝 Internship Tasks  
- **Task 1 (Preprocessing):**  
  - Handle missing values (mean/median/mode).  
  - Encode categorical variables with One-Hot Encoding.  
  - Standardize numerical features using `StandardScaler`.  
  - Save cleaned dataset for reuse.  

- **Task 2 (Logistic Regression):**  
  - Train and evaluate a logistic regression model.  
  - Interpret coefficients and performance metrics.  

- **Task 3 (Neural Network):**  
  - Build a feed-forward neural network with TensorFlow/Keras.  
  - Train and evaluate using the MNIST dataset.  

*(Additional tasks will be added as the internship progresses.)*

## 📊 Datasets Used  
- **Titanic dataset** (via Seaborn): Chosen for its mix of categorical and numerical features, 
  as well as realistic missing values, making it ideal for practicing data preprocessing and 
  binary classification.  

- **Breast Cancer dataset** (scikit-learn): For logistic regression.  

- **MNIST dataset** (Keras): For neural network modeling.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- TensorFlow/Keras

## 📌 Key Learnings  
- Preprocessing real-world data (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).  
- Building classical ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests).  
- Implementing deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Writing clean, reusable code with functions (e.g., `wrangle()` preprocessing pipeline).  
- Documenting and sharing progress professionally.
